          I am a Machine Learning Engineer at H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, 
          working at the intersection of artificial intelligence and oncology. My research focuses on 
          developing innovative machine learning frameworks for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment optimization.

          I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering (Machine Learning) from the University of South Florida, 
          where my dissertation explored multimodal AI-driven biomarkers for early detection of cancer cachexia. 
          My work spans multimodal data integration, uncertainty quantification, computer vision, 
          and transformer-based NLP for clinical applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prior to academia, I accumulated over 15 years of industry experience in telecommunications 
          and network analytics, leading engineering teams and large-scale data projects at Jazz VEON Company in Pakistan.
